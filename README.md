# Backend Capstone Requirements

## Your capstone must use C# and the .net Framework.

I know we talked breifly about using other technologies, I received clarification around that, and you are not allowed.

## Your project idea must be your idea, not something for a friend or a potential client.

You should be intrinsically motivated to complete this project.  Its ok if the idea originated from discussions with someone else, but they should not be driving the features or adding any deadlines.

### Other than that...

- All project ideas and scopes must be approved by a manager.  Come to class on Tuesday (5/30) with an idea or two ready.
  - Remember that you only have 3 weeks.  
- Use github projects to break your features up into vertical slices.
  - This should be done by Saturday (6/3)
- Each week you will be giving your manager a synopsis of what you are going to accomplish in that week.  Like a sprint.  Mk?
- Its a good idea to showcase a SPA.  It will allow you to show off both your front-end and backend skills.
- The front end framework you use can be something that is not AngularJS
- Don't do a game.  Its probably not going to get approved by your manager.
